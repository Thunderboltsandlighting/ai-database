{"response":"Hi Tim! I've analyzed the data for you regarding Dustin's contribution to your monthly overhead expenses at Hendersonville Counseling PLLC.\n\nIt appears that Dustin's performance has been inconsistent across the years, with a notable decline from 2023 levels. In 2023, he covered 204.4% of the overhead costs, resulting in a $1,387.38 surplus each month. However, in 2025, his coverage rate dropped to 23.2%, indicating that he's currently not meeting the monthly overhead expenses.\n\nBreaking down the numbers further, I see that Dustin needs to generate around $2,043.85 per month to cover the expenses. Based on the provided data, it seems that he would need approximately 32 transactions per month at an average revenue of $64.56 to meet this target.\n\nConsidering the current situation, I'd say that Dustin is not covering his share of the overhead expenses in 2025. The shortfalls are significant, with a monthly shortage of $1,020.19. To put it simply, Tim, your organization might need to reassess Dustin's contract and explore ways to improve his performance or adjust expectations.\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspects of this analysis?"}
