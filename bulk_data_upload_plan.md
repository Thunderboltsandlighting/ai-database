# Historical Data Upload Plan (4 Years)

## Overview
Systematic approach to upload 4 years of historical medical billing data while maintaining data quality and system performance.

## Phase 1: Data Organization (Week 1)

### 1.1 File Structure Setup
```
csv_folder/
├── historical/
│   ├── 2021/
│   │   ├── billing/
│   │   ├── payroll/
│   │   └── performance/
│   ├── 2022/
│   │   ├── billing/
│   │   ├── payroll/
│   │   └── performance/
│   ├── 2023/
│   │   ├── billing/
│   │   ├── payroll/
│   │   └── performance/
│   └── 2024/
│       ├── billing/
│       ├── payroll/
│       └── performance/
└── current/
    ├── billing/ (your existing data)
    ├── payroll/
    └── performance/
```

### 1.2 Data Preparation Checklist
- [ ] **Headers Standardization**: Ensure all historical files use same column names
- [ ] **Date Format Consistency**: Standardize date formats (MM/DD/YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] **Provider Name Cleanup**: Consistent provider naming across years
- [ ] **File Naming Convention**: YYYY-MM-DD_Category_Description.csv

## Phase 2: Bulk Upload Strategy (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Upload Order (Recommended)
1. **Providers First**: Upload provider/contract data to establish relationships
2. **Oldest to Newest**: Start with 2021, progress to 2024
3. **Category by Category**: Complete billing for all years, then payroll, then performance

### 2.2 Batch Upload Script
```python
# Create automated upload script
def upload_historical_data():
    years = ['2021', '2022', '2023', '2024']
    categories = ['billing', 'payroll', 'performance']
    
    for year in years:
        for category in categories:
            folder_path = f"csv_folder/historical/{year}/{category}"
            upload_folder_contents(folder_path)
            
    # Verify data integrity after each year
    verify_data_integrity(year)
```

### 2.3 Quality Assurance
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor rows processed, success rates
- **Data Quality Reports**: Review issues after each batch
- **Performance Metrics**: Track processing speed (should maintain 1000+ rows/second)
- **Database Size Monitoring**: Check disk space usage

## Phase 3: Analysis & Insights (Week 4)

### 3.1 Overall Picture Queries
After upload completion, run comprehensive analysis:

#### Revenue Trends (4-Year Overview)
```sql
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y', transaction_date) as year,
    strftime('%Y-%m', transaction_date) as month,
    SUM(cash_applied) as monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT provider_id) as active_providers
FROM payment_transactions 
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
```

#### Provider Performance Evolution
```sql
SELECT 
    p.provider_name,
    strftime('%Y', pt.transaction_date) as year,
    SUM(pt.cash_applied) as annual_revenue,
    COUNT(*) as transactions,
    AVG(pt.cash_applied) as avg_payment
FROM providers p
JOIN payment_transactions pt ON p.provider_id = pt.provider_id
GROUP BY p.provider_name, year
ORDER BY p.provider_name, year;
```

#### Insurance/Payer Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    payer_name,
    strftime('%Y', transaction_date) as year,
    SUM(cash_applied) as payer_revenue,
    COUNT(*) as claim_count,
    AVG(cash_applied) as avg_claim_value
FROM payment_transactions 
WHERE payer_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY payer_name, year
ORDER BY year, payer_revenue DESC;
```

### 3.2 Granular Analysis Capabilities
- **Monthly trends by provider**
- **Seasonal patterns in revenue**
- **Payer mix evolution over time**
- **Provider lifecycle analysis (when they joined/left)**
- **Service category performance trends**

## Phase 4: Advanced Analytics Setup (Week 5)

### 4.1 Automated Reporting
- **Weekly upload workflow**: Streamlined process for new data
- **Dashboard creation**: Key metrics visualization
- **Anomaly detection**: Identify unusual patterns
- **Benchmark establishment**: Set performance baselines from historical data

### 4.2 Predictive Analytics Preparation
- **Revenue forecasting models**
- **Provider performance predictions**
- **Seasonal adjustment factors**
- **Growth trend analysis**

## Expected Outcomes

### Data Volume Estimates
- **Current**: 3,578 transactions
- **4-Year Historical**: Estimated 50,000-200,000 transactions
- **Processing Time**: 2-8 hours total (depending on volume)
- **Storage**: 100-500MB database size

### Business Insights You'll Gain
1. **4-Year Revenue Trends**: Growth patterns, seasonal cycles
2. **Provider Evolution**: Performance changes, lifecycle analysis
3. **Payer Relationship History**: Payment trends, reliability patterns
4. **Market Position**: How your practice has evolved
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Processing improvements over time

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Backup Strategy
- [ ] **Pre-upload backup**: Full database backup before historical import
- [ ] **Incremental backups**: After each year's data
- [ ] **Rollback plan**: Ability to restore to any checkpoint

### Quality Control
- [ ] **Sample verification**: Spot-check random records after upload
- [ ] **Totals reconciliation**: Verify revenue totals match source data
- [ ] **Date range validation**: Ensure no data outside expected ranges
- [ ] **Provider consistency**: Verify provider names match expectations
